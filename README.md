# Zetamec-rs

A command-line implementation of the Zetamac arithmetic challenge, written in Rust.

Zetamac is a timed drill that tests your arithmetic skills. You have a set amount of time to answer as many arithmetic questions as possible. This tool is inspired by the web-based Zetamac, which is often used for practice in quantitative finance interviews.
